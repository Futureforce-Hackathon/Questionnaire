# FutureForce July 2020 Hackathon! 
Code for the July 2020 Virtual Hackathon hosted by Futureforce. 

## Recruitment/Leadership Development: 
#### *"Create solutions that address Diversity & Inclusion, empowering companies to create an equitable workforce."*

This program takes user input such as ethnicity, gender, undergraduate year, and more to find the best programs they should apply for!
Currenlty this program works on a point system where the closer the program fits to the users diversity the more points that program receives.

The top of the generated list has the most points, therefore being the best choice. At the moment, this only looks through a predetermined CSV file.
A web scraping feature was theorized and may come to light some day.
